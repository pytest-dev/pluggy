0.6.0
-----

- Drop support for EOL Python 2.6 and 3.3 in PR `#103`_.
- Use ``inspect.getfullargspec()`` in Python 3 to avoid issuing a deprecation warning for ``inspect.getargspec()`` (`#81`_).

.. _#81: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy/issues/81

0.5.2
-----
- fix bug where ``firstresult`` wrappers were being sent an incorrectly configured
  ``_Result`` (a list was set instead of a single value). Add tests to check for
  this as well as ``_Result.force_result()`` behaviour. Thanks to `@tgoodlet`_
  for the PR `#72`_.

- fix incorrect ``getattr``  of ``DeprecationWarning`` from the ``warnings``
  module. Thanks to `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR `#77`_.

- hide ``pytest`` tracebacks in certain core routines. Thanks to
  `@nicoddemus`_ for the PR `#80`_.

0.5.1
-----
- fix a bug and add tests for case where ``firstresult`` hooks return
  ``None`` results. Thanks to `@RonnyPfannschmidt`_ and `@tgoodlet`_
  for the issue (`#68`_) and PR (`#69`_) respectively.

0.5.0
-----

- fix bug where callbacks for historic hooks would not be called for
  already registered plugins.  Thanks `@vodik`_ for the PR
  and `@hpk42`_ for further fixes.

- fix `#17`_ by considering only actual functions for hooks
  this removes the ability to register arbitrary callable objects
  which at first glance is a reasonable simplification,
  thanks `@RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for report and pr.

- fix `#19`_: allow registering hookspecs from instances.  The PR from
  `@tgoodlet`_ also modernized the varnames implementation.

- resolve `#32`_: split up the test set into multiple modules.
  Thanks to `@RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the PR and `@tgoodlet`_ for
  the initial request.

- resolve `#14`_: add full sphinx docs. Thanks to `@tgoodlet`_ for
  PR `#39`_.

- add hook call mismatch warnings. Thanks to `@tgoodlet`_ for the
  PR `#42`_.

- resolve `#44`_: move to new-style classes. Thanks to `@MichalTHEDUDE`_
  for PR `#46`_.

- add baseline benchmarking/speed tests using ``pytest-benchmark``
  in PR `#54`_.  Thanks to `@tgoodlet`_.

- update the README to showcase the API. Thanks to `@tgoodlet`_ for the
  issue and PR `#55`_.

- deprecate ``__multicall__`` and add a faster call loop implementation.
  Thanks to `@tgoodlet`_ for PR `#58`_.

- raise a comprehensible error when a ``hookimpl`` is called with positional
  args. Thanks to `@RonnyPfannschmidt`_ for the issue and `@tgoodlet`_ for
  PR `#60`_.

- fix the ``firstresult`` test making it more complete
  and remove a duplicate of that test. Thanks to `@tgoodlet`_
  for PR `#62`_.
